wordpress theme for Matt Logan

I worked on this theme for a few weeks, and did not use GIT SVN for that development, I did however want to learn how to use GIT, and had this project handy for inclusion in my studies. 

I did do some fun things with the porject, such as customizing the theme to be a single page smooth scroll dealie. 

That is all for now.

thanks!
